House Price Prediction 

OVERVIEW :-
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm. It aims to help users estimate the value of a house based on features such as location, size, and other relevant factors.

DATASET :-
The Dataset used in this project we fetch from scikit-learn.Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library that implements a range of machine learning, pre-processing, cross-validation, and visualization algorithms using a unified interface.

DATASET INFORMATION :-
The dataset used in this project consists of information about different residential properties. It includes a wide range of features that can potentially influence the price of a house, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, neighborhood characteristics, and other relevant factors.

OBJECTIVE :-
The main objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust predictive model for house price estimation. By training the model on historical data and leveraging its learned patterns and relationships, it will be able to predict the prices of new or unseen houses accurately.

APPROACH :-
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables will be employed to prepare the dataset for model training. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, random forests will be explored and evaluated to determine the most suitable model for accurate price prediction.
